# SoraClient Bedrock — Releases

This repo is used to publish **SoraClient Bedrock (Windows x64)** updates.

It contains:
- **Releases**: the versioned `.zip` packages
- `manifest/stable.json`: the update manifest used by the SoraClient Launcher

This is **not** the source code repository.

If you got SoraClient from anywhere other than the official links, don’t run it.
